# Flaming Hangout Rules
**1. Encourage respectful discussion**
Any disrespect, harassment or bashing of other members or groups (and idols) will be met with warnings and punishments.

**2. Use only English**
That helps the staff team to track any rules breakers way easier!

**3. Use common sense**
A few rules fall under this. Do not impersonate or pretend to be staff, do not make yourself hard to deal with, do not discuss infractions in public and don't ask for free stuff.

**4. No NSFW/NSFL content allowed**
This includes NSFW videos/photos/links. Sexualizing minors is a instant ban even if not done in this server.

**5. Do not advertise**
Advertising other servers, self-advertising, soliciting donations, and any other types of advertising is not permitted.

**6. Feel free to contact staff**
The staff can help you with any problem that is related to the server, please dont disturb staff if you don't need anything!
